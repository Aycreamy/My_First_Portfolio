    <h3>My Journey</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>I am learning HTML and building my first portfolio website from scratch.</p>
    <p>This project is part of my training with ALX and I am excited about the journey ahead.</p>
    <p>In this page, I amm using headings, paragraphs, and even images with links!</p>
    <p>My wife Omotolani has been a huge supportive system on this journey.</p>
    <p>As I continue learning, I will keep adding more features to this site.</p>
